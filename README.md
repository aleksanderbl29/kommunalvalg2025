This project is an attempt at implementing a hierarchical Bayesian
prediction model for the municipal elections in Denmark on the 18th of
November 2025. This codebase is mainly R (with a tiny bit of STAN) setup
with as a `targets` pipeline using `stantargets` (and `cmdstanr` behind
the scenes) for the Bayesian modeling.
